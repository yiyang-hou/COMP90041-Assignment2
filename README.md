# The University of Melborne - Master of IT - COMP90041
## Assignment 2

This repository contains my submission for assignment 2 of the subject COMP90041 Programming and Software Development.

<p>The goal of this assignment is to write a Java program named SimpleCompetitions that helps companies (e.g., retailers) create competitions to boost their sales. For instance, during Easter Sale, a retailer can use the software to create a lucky draw game. In the game, a customer is given entries equivalent to the size of its purchase after their single purchase final balance, after discounts, reach a specific amount, say $50. Once the competition time ends, the retailer draws winners and the winning customers will get points
added to their membership account; customers can use these points for future purchases if they wish.</p>
